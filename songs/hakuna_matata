    What a wonderful phrase\n
    Hakuna Matata!\n
    Ain't no passing craze\n
    It means no worries\n
    For the rest of your days\n
    It's our problem-free philosophy\n
    Hakuna Matata!\n

    When I was a young wart-hoooog!\n
    Very nice!\n
    Thanks!\n
    He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal\n
    He could clear the Savannah after every meal\n
    I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned\n
    And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind\n
    And oh, the shame\n
    (He was ashamed!)\n
    Thought of changin' my name\n
    (Oh, what's in a name?)\n
    And I got downhearted\n
    (How did you feel?)\n

    Hakuna Matata!\n
    What a wonderful phrase\n
    Hakuna Matata!\n
    Ain't no passing craze\n
    It means no worries\n
    For the rest of your days\n
    Yeah, sing it, kid!\n
    It's our problem-free philosophy\n
    Hakuna Matata!\n
    Hakuna Matata\n
    Hakuna Matata\n
    Hakuna Matata\n
    Hakuna\n
    It means no worries\n
    For the rest of your days\n
    It's our problem-free philosophy\n
    Hakuna Matata\n"
