### Current songs (more to come!):
- Hakuna Matata
- Can you feel the love tonight?
- Stand by me

### Current flexibility:
- Ignores punctuation i.e "who?" = "who"
- Ignores repeating characters i.e "whoo" = "who"
- levenshtein algorithm i.e "And the land iz darc" = "And the land is dark"

### TODO:
- Better Regex to consider more possible versions of a string
  - punctuation agnostic (v1) - DONE
  - close/similar/typos representations of words would work i.e "wart-hoooog" = "warthog" (v2) - DONE
- More efficient searching algorithms (v3) - DONE
- Support at least 3 songs (v4) - DONE
- Provide initial greeting message (v5) - DONE
- Chatbot display typing for every message (v6)
- Find out how to make the chatbot recognized by FB (v7)
- Sing to Timon and Bumpa and they sing back the next sentance! (v8)
  - Use shazam to recognize song and if see if you can transcribe meaningful audio to text
- Respond with a variety of (custom made) GIFs, video snippets and text (v9)
  - If short response use GIF
- Chatbot intent / context = which 'hakuna matata' (v10)
- Investigate FB NLP if useful (v11)
- Investigate if multi-threading is needed
- Analytics for chatbot (v12)
- Website for chatbot (v13)
