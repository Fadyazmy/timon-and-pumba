### Current songs (more to come!):
- Hakuna Matata

### Current flexibility:
- Ignores punctuation i.e "who?" = "who"
- Ignores repeating characters i.e "whoo" = "who"

### TODO:
- Better Regex to consider more possible versions of a string
  - punctuation agnostic (v1) - DONE
  - close/similar/typos representations of words would work i.e "wart-hoooog" = "warthog" (v2) - DONE
- More efficient searching algorithms (v3) - DONE
- Support at least 3 songs (v4) - DONE
- Provide initial greetings, and find out how to make the chatbot recognized by FB
